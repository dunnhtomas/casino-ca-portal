# PRD #32: Popular Slots Detailed Section

## üìã Project Overview
**Feature Name:** Popular Slots Detailed Section  
**Project Type:** Homepage Section Implementation  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days  
**Target Completion:** 2025-01-20  

## üéØ Executive Summary
Implement a comprehensive "Popular Slots Detailed" section for the casino.ca replica homepage, featuring top slot games with detailed information including RTP, volatility, themes, features, and playable demos. This section enhances user engagement, provides valuable gaming insights, and drives traffic through high-converting slot content.

## üîç Problem Statement
The current homepage lacks a dedicated section showcasing popular slot games with detailed analytics and playable content. This gap reduces user engagement and misses opportunities for SEO traffic from slot-specific searches. Casino.ca's slot section is a major traffic driver that we need to replicate with enhanced functionality.

## üë• Target Users

- **Secondary:** Casual players exploring game options
