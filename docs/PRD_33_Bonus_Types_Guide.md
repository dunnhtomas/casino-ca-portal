# PRD #33: Bonus Types Comprehensive Guide

## üìã Project Overview
**Feature Name:** Bonus Types Comprehensive Guide Section  
**Project Type:** Homepage Section Implementation  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days  
**Target Completion:** 2025-01-20  

## üéØ Executive Summary
Implement a comprehensive "Bonus Types Guide" section for the casino.ca replica homepage, featuring detailed explanations of all major casino bonus categories with interactive calculators, T&C breakdowns, and strategic advice. This section educates users about bonus types, helping them make informed decisions and enhancing trust.

Casino.ca's bonus education is a key trust-building element we need to replicate.
