## 📈 **BACKGROUND & STRATEGIC FIT**

**Why are we doing this?**
Casino.ca has a massive interactive grid with 90+ casino logos allowing users to compare hundreds of options at once. Our current 15-casino limit severely restricts user choice and positions us as a limited comparison site rather than a comprehensive casino directory.

**How does this fit into company objectives?**
This transforms us from a basic casino review site to a comprehensive casino comparison platform, matching industry leaders and providing complete market coverage for Canadian players.

**Market Context:**
- **Casino.ca Analysis:** Interactive grid with 90+ casino thumbnails, filtering, search, detailed overlays
- **User Demand:** Users want to see all available options, not just top choices
- **Competitive Pressure:** Comprehensive databases are table stakes for casino comparison sites
