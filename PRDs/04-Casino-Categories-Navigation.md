## üìà **BACKGROUND & STRATEGIC FIT**

**Why are we doing this?**
Casino.ca organizes their extensive casino database through multiple category filters (Live Dealer, Mobile, Crypto, New, etc.) allowing users to find exactly what they're looking for. Our current flat structure limits user discovery and creates missed conversion opportunities.

**How does this fit into company objectives?**
This transforms our site from a simple list to an organized casino discovery platform, improving user experience and diversifying our affiliate revenue streams across different casino categories.

**Market Context:**

- **Casino.ca Analysis:** 8+ distinct casino categories (Live Dealer, Mobile, Crypto, New, etc.)
- **User Behavior:** Players have specific preferences (payment methods, game types, bonus styles)
- **Competitive Need:** Category navigation is essential for comprehensive casino sites
