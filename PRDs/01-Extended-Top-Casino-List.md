## 📈 **BACKGROUND & STRATEGIC FIT**

**Why are we doing this?**
Currently we have only 10 basic casino listings while casino.ca has 15 fully detailed casinos with comprehensive specs (ratings, RTPs, establishment dates, payout speeds, game counts). This gap significantly undermines our credibility and user experience.

**How does this fit into company objectives?**
This is foundational to our goal of becoming Canada's premier casino review site. Without detailed casino data, we cannot compete with established players or provide value to users seeking comprehensive casino information.

**Market Context:**
- **Casino.ca Analysis:** They provide 4.7/5 ratings, establishment dates, 97.39% RTPs, 1-3 day payout speeds, 700+ game counts
- **User Demand:** Users expect detailed specifications before choosing casinos
- **Competitive Pressure:** We must match industry standards for casino review depth

---

## 🧠 **ASSUMPTIONS**

**Technical Assumptions:**
- Our current PHP/MySQL architecture can handle detailed casino data
- OpenAI API can generate realistic but varied casino specifications
- Our database schema can be extended for additional casino fields

**Business Assumptions:**
- Users value detailed casino specifications over basic information
- More detailed information leads to higher conversion rates
- Comprehensive data builds trust and authority

**User Assumptions:**
- Users compare casinos based on RTP, payout speed, and game variety
- Users trust sites with detailed, specific information
- Users use ratings and establishment dates for decision-making
